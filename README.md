# ElasticPortable

This is a small pcl to make it possible to access elasticsearch from your xamarin apps. 
To run the tests you need a running elasticsearch server somewhere on your network. 

The library itself uses Newtonsoft JSON library to translate to and from json.

DISCLAIMER: this is only version 0.1, not ready for production yet
